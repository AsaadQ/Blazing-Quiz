      `After reading through every single of the 101 postmortems, we’ve learned there is rarely one reason for a single startup’s failure. However, we did begin to see a pattern to these stories. And so, after sifting through the post-mortems, we identified the top 20 reasons startups failed. Since many startups offered multiple reasons for their failure, you’ll see the chart highlighting the top 20 reasons doesn’t add up to 100% (it far exceeds it). Following the chart is an explanation of each reason and relevant examples from the postmortems. `,
      
     ` Reason 20 – Failure to Pivot
      Not pivoting away or quickly enough from a bad product, a bad hire, or a bad decision was cited as a reason for failure in 7% of the post mortems. Dwelling or being married to a bad idea can sap resources and money as well as leave employees frustrated by a lack of progress.`,

      `Reason 19 – Burn Out:
        Work-life balance is not something that startup founders often get, so the risk of burning out is high. Burnout was given as a reason for failure 8% of the time. The ability to cut your losses where necessary and redirect your efforts when you see a dead end was deemed important to succeeding and avoiding burnout, as was having a solid, diverse, and driven team so that responsibilities can be shared.
      `,
      ` Reason 18 – Didn’t use Network:
    
        We often hear about startup entrepreneurs lamenting their lack of network or investor connections, so we were surprised to see that one of the reasons for failure was entrepreneurs who said they did not properly utilize their own network. Get your investors involved. Your investors are there to help you. Get them involved from the start, and don’t be afraid to ask for help.
      `,
      ` Reason 17 – Legal Challenges:
      Sometimes a startup can evolve from a simple idea and enter a world of legal complexities that can ultimately shut it down.
      `,
      `Reason 16 – No Financing: 
            Tying to the more common reason of running out of cash, a number of startup founders explicitly cited a lack of investor interest either at the seed follow-on stage (the Series A Crunch) or at all.
            `,
      `
          Reason 15 – Failed Geographical Expansion:
     
            Location was an issue in a couple of different ways. The first was that there has to be congruence between your startup’s concept and location. Location also played a role in failure for remote teams. The key being that if your team is working remotely, make sure you find effective communication methods, otherwise lack of teamwork and planning could lead to failure.
            `,
      `Reason 14 – Lack Passion: 
            There are many good ideas out there in the world, but 9% of startup post-mortem founders found that a lack of passion for a domain and a lack of knowledge of a domain were key reasons for failure no matter how good an idea is.
            `,
      `Reason 13 – Pivot Gone Bad: 
            Pivots like Burbn to Instagram or ThePoint to Groupon can go extraordinarily well. Or they can start you down the wrong road. Pivoting for pivoting’s sake is worthless. It should be a calculated affair, where changes to the business model are made, hypotheses are tested, and results are measured. Otherwise, you can’t learn anything.
            `,
      `
          Reason 12 – Disharmony Among Team/Investors:
       
     
            Discord with a cofounder was a fatal issue for startup post-mortem companies. But acrimony isn’t limited to the founding team, and when things go bad with an investor, it can get ugly pretty quickly.
            `,
      `Reason 11 – Lose Focus: 
            Getting sidetracked by distracting projects, personal issues, and/or general loss of focus was mentioned in 13% of stories as a contributor to failure.
            `,
      `Reason 10 – Product Mistimed:
            If you release your product too early, users may write it off as not good enough and getting them back may be difficult if their first impression of you is negative. And if you release your product too late, you may have missed your window of opportunity in the market.
            `,
      `Reason 9 – Ignore Customers: 
            Ignoring users is a tried and true way to fail. Tunnel vision and not gathering user feedback are fatal flaws for most tech startups.
            `,
      `Reason 8 – Poor Marketing:
            Knowing your target audience and knowing how to get their attention and convert them to leads and ultimately customers is one of the most important skills of a successful business. But an inability to market was a common failure especially among founders who liked to code or build product but who didn’t relish the idea of promoting the product.
            `,
      `
          Reason 7 – Product without a business model:
      
            Most failed founders agree that a business model is important – staying wedded to a single channel or failing to find ways to make money at scale left investors hesitant and founders unable to capitalize on any traction gained.
            `,
      `
          Reason 6 – User un-friendly product:
     
            Bad things happen when you ignore what a user wants and need, whether consciously or accidentally.
            `,
            ` Reason 5 –
            Pricing is a dark art when it comes to startup success, and startup post-mortems highlight the difficulty in pricing a product high enough to eventually cover costs but low enough to bring in customers.
            `,
      `Reason 4 – Get outcompeted: 
            Despite the platitudes that startups shouldn’t pay attention to the competition, the reality is that once an idea gets hot or gets market validation, there may be many entrants in a space. And while obsessing over the competition is not healthy, ignoring them was also a recipe for failure in 19% of the startup failures.
            `,
      `>Reason 3 – Not the right team:
    
            A diverse team with different skill sets was often cited as being critical to the success of a company. Failure post-mortems often lamented that “I wish we had a CTO from the start,” or wished that the startup had “a founder that loved the business aspect of things.” In some cases, the founding team wished they had more checks and balances. As Nouncer’s founder wrote, “This brings me back to the underlying problem I didn’t have a partner to balance me out and provide sanity checks for business and technology decisions made.”
            `,
      `Reason 2 – Ran out of Cash: 
            Money and time are finite and need to be allocated judiciously. The question of how you should spend your money was a frequent conundrum and reason for failure cited by startups (29%).
            `,
      `Reason 1 – No market need
            Tackling problems that are interesting to solve rather than those that serve a market need was cited as the No. 1 reason for failure, noted in 42% of cases. Our study shows that failing to do this is one of the easiest ways to guarantee startup failure.

      `STARTUPS ARE NEWLY created companies with little or no history of facing high volatility in technologies and markets. In the US alone, 476,000 new businesses are established each month,1 accounting for nearly 20 percent of job creation.2 As such, startups are an important factor in the economy. However, the environment of startups is dynamic, unpredictable, and even chaotic, forcing entrepreneurs to act quickly, fail fast, and learn faster to fi nd a market niche and acquire a sustainable income. Sixty percent of startups don’t survive the fi rst fi ve years, and 75 percent of venture capital funded startups fail.3 Most of this is due to the high risk of startups, missed market windows, and other business reasons. To what extend engineering practices impact this high failure rate is still unknown given the premature state of research. `,
      'Startup Software Development ',
      ' \“Done is better than perfect\” and “move fast and break things\” are slogans you might read when entering a startup workspace. What stands behind those slogans is a summary of more than 200 working practices. We reviewed these to point out where gaps exist and future development and research are warranted. Process Management Is Agile, Evolutionary, and Opportunistic Process management represents all the engineering activities used to manage product development in startups. Because the flexibility to accommodate frequent changes is essential in the startup context, agile methodologies have been considered the most viable process—they embrace change, allowing development to adapt to the business strategy.5 Fast release with an iterative and incremental approach shortens the lead time from idea conception to production with fast deployment. A variant to agile is the lean methodology,6 which advocates the identification of the riskiest parts of a software business and provides a minimum viable product to systematically test and plan modification for the next iteration. In this regard, prototyping is essential to shorten the time to market. To allow better prototyping activities, evolutionary workflows are needed to implement “soft-coded” solutions in the first phases until the optimal solution is found.',
      'Software Development Is Driven by Customers who Act as Designers',
      'They’re constantly optimizing the problem/solution fit. To achieve it, startups must discover the real needs of their first customers, testing business speculations only by defining a minimal set of functional requirements.8 Several authors acknowledge the importance of involving the customer/user in the process of eliciting and prioritizing requirements according to their primary needs. However, the market-driven nature of those requirements also demands alternatives.In the startup context, customers often steer requirements, and developers must be ready to embrace change from day one. Employing architectural practices and frameworks that enable easy extension of the design can dramatically benefit the alignment between the product and market uncertainty. Scientific evidence also points to the advantages of constant code refactoring.',
      'The Team Is the Catalyst of Development',
      'Empowerment of team members represents the main viable strategy for enhancing performance and success.11 The team must be able to absorb and learn from trial and error quickly enough to adapt to new emergent practices. Working on innovative products requires creativity—an ability to adapt to new roles and face new challenges every day, working overtime if necessary. In addition, having previous experience in similar business domains and exhibiting entrepreneurial characteristics (courage, enthusiasm, commitment, leadership) are important parts of a startup employee’s skillset. Collocation is essential to facilitate informal communication and close interactions between team members.',
      'Tools Can Accommodate Product and Management Changes',
      'Easy-to-implement tools, such as whiteboards and technologies that can handle fast-paced changing information, will lower a startup’s training and maintenance costs. To mitigate the lack of resources, startups often appear to take advantage of open source solutions when possible, which also give them access to a large pool of evaluators and evolving contributions.      To quickly validate the product, they tend to use agile and lean methods in an ad hoc manner. Evidence suggests that engineering activities must be tailored to the startup context to allow flexibility and reactiveness in development workflows.',

      `Introduction`,
      `
      Innovative software products are having a strong impact on human society and industry. On the way to find an innovative idea and to turn it into commercial product, software startups often face several barriers. Firstly, innovative product is often initiated in a dynamic context, where not only its functionalities but also customers are unknown from the beginning. Secondly, due to technological pull and market push effects, typical business activities in a software startup are mixed in a process of the search of problems for developed products and the search of solutions for targeted customers. `,
      'Background',
      'Complexity Perspective of Software Development ',
      'Software project is very similar to a Complex Adaptive System (CAS), characterized by a dynamic network of customers, software designer, developers, 3rd party partners and external stakeholders, parallel and proactively reacting to what the other stakeholders are doing. All in all, rigid and heavy software development processes are not a mean to support sensing, probing and acting in chaotic space of customers and requirements. Instead, flexible and reactive approaches, designed to stimulate customer feedback, can increase the number of perspectives and solutions available to project managers [16]. Moreover, there is also a gap in understanding the intertwined process of innovation generation and product implementation. Non-development activities need to be captured as they closely relate to how product features are elicited.',
      'The Need of Software Startup Process',
      'Previous sections emphasize a need to have a theory-based model to capture both innovation and engineering processes at complex and chaotic situations. We were inspired by a hunter-gatherer model by Martin et al. to explain how innovative ideas is created and implemented [2]. The model introduces a distinction between a hunter tasked to find an innovative idea and a gatherer tasked to implement the idea. While hunting the idea though ambiguity spaces has change-driven, analytical and qualitative nature; gathering the idea across predetermined paths has plan-oriented, optimizedable and quantitative nature. Alternatively, we can think of hunting as a mean to manage the unordered domain when gathering is to manage the ordered domain. From this aspect, a software startup can be characterized by: (1) The activities that occur in different situation (hunting activities or gathering activities) (2) The environment in which innovate ideas/ prototypes/ products will be tested (3) The speed of transitions between different phases of software startup.',

      '',
      'Commonalities Among Cases',
      'To read the company stories click here',
      'There are several commonalities among the three stories. Firstly, the interviews showed that hunting and gathering activities evolve along with the movement of startups from the Unknown to the Known domain. The effort and time needed to move from the Unknown to the Known in different domains varied a lot. Secondly, all cases showed that the early phases of software startups are dominant by non-development activities. Most of them are hunting-type activities with not much focus on software domain. Instead, hunting was focusing on idea refinement, team building and funding domains.Thirdly, innovative ideas initiated from the personal experiences of the founder and refined over time. The experiences triggering the idea vary a lot, from having fun to a severe accident. Lastly, all the companies faced the difficulty of funding the initial phases. The solutions varied from the founding team’s personal investment to extensive usage of startup subsidies and to external risk capital investors.'
